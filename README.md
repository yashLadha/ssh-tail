## ssh-tail

Simple binary to tail log files from remote ssh machines and store them locally
into your system for debugging or storage purpose. Currently working on
implementing the local file system sink.

It assumes that you have an unecrypted private key and present in your home
folder inside an `.ssh` folder.
